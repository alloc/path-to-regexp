# @alloc/path-to-regexp

This is a fork of [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) with a few changes:

- Removed CommonJS support
- Targets ES2020 instead of ES2015
- Added `type: "module"` to the package.json
- Has its `exports` field set up correctly
- Updated the build process to use [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/)
